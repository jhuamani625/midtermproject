## Summary of the Pandas Library
Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation framework designed on top of the Python programming language that is fast, efficient, scalable, and simple to use. Its aim is to serve as the foundational high-level building block for doing real-world data analysis in Python.

## Install and Run Instructions (Pyhton Version 3.9 64-bit)
To install pandas(main library), in the visual studio terminal you use the command pip install pandas
```console
$ pip install pandas
```

## The Code
This midtemproject.py file allows the user to create and genreate a dataframe from scratch with the use of the pandas library.

### Key important areas
- createcsvfile() is defined in line 9 and its used in line 77
- lines 22-28 & lines 33-39: Try and Catch are used if user enters in an invalid input for # of rows and columns
- lines 45-51: User is asked to input data once matrix size is defined
- lines 54-58: Check the datatypes that if the user has inputed in the dataset a str or an int.
- lines 61-63 & lines 66-68: Ask user to add names for the rows and coloumns
- line 71: using one the pandas library function DataFrame to create a dataframe
- line 73: prints out the dataframe
- line 77: using the createcsvfile function that was defined in line 9 to create a file name with an extension of csv and generate the file

## Future Idea
Using the pandas library and some other supportive libraries, I would like to work on something to do with datat science or a web application that focusses on current trends that 
the world needs as an something to do with stock market or security.

The pandas library would be helpful for organizaing the raw data from a source, analyzing it and make predicitions, ask questions, and visualizing and comming up with a story taht summarizes the whole purpose of our study. 

#The midtermproject.py file is the one that needs to run
